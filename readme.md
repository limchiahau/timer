# TIMER

This is a simple script that rings when a user defined amount of time has passed.

Usage:  
`python3 timer.py 10`

With the above command the timer will ring after 10 minutes.

## Plans for improvements 

### I plan to add the ability to define multiple timer at once. 

For example:  
`python3 timer py 2 10`

This should ring first at 2 minutes and then another 10 minutes later.

### I plan to display a countdown in the terminal window.

Ideally after running the command you should see a coundown timer and numbers of timers that are left in the queue.
