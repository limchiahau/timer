# Timer

This is a simple script that rings when a user defined amount of time has passed.

Usage:

    python3 timer.py 10

*With the above command the timer will ring after 10 minutes.*

Usage:

    python3 timer.py 5 10

*With the above command the timer will ring at 5 minutes and another time 10 minutes later.*

## Plans for improvements 

### I plan to display a countdown in the terminal window.

Ideally after running the command you should see a coundown timer and numbers of timers that are left in the queue.
